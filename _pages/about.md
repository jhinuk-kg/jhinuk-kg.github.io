Biography
======
Hello and thank you for visiting. I am currently a research-based M.A. student in Sociology at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, with a focus on the sociology of globalization, race, and racialization. My academic journey is complemented by a rich tapestry of experiences ranging from teaching assistant roles at Queen's University to research internships that span the globe.

My professional and research experiences have been diverse, including a project manager role at QMIND, Queen's University, where I supervised research projects on AI ethics and policy, and various research internships focusing on diaspora, transnationalism, and AI policies. Additionally, my work as a content writer for Gradifying and Sociology Group has allowed me to explore the intersections of sociology, policy, and technology through a creative lens.

Interests

* Sociology of Globalization and its Impact on Race and Racialization
